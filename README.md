# robot

### Considerations:
    - Could have used a Strategy pattern to implement the robot's movement and action parsing, but seemed overkill in this case.
    - This is my first time setting up a NodeJS project (and have been over 2 years since last working with the technology)

### Installing:
    1 - Clone this repository
    2 -  Run 'npm i'
    3 - Run 'npx tsc index.ts robot.ts'
    4 - Run 'node index.ts'
    5 - Modify 'instructions.txt' as you desire
    6 - Repeat 3, 4 and 5 as long as you want
